# FoodConsumption

Project realized for Aalto University course CS-E4450: Explorative Information Visualization

Install requirements: `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
Start the server: `$ python manage.py runserver`

## Presentation of the project
 
I made this visualization to raise awareness on the evolution of our meat consumption and the impacts it has on our health, on the environment and on animal welfare. The goal was to offer a way for people to visualize the average quantity of meat (ruminants, poultry, fish) they would consume over a year by comparing the resources needed and the greenhouse gas generated by each type of food.

Feel free to explore the four main charts, respectively representing the average consumption of different types of food per person per year, the corresponding water and land used for their production and the quantity of greenhouse gas emmitted. The visualization also provides information about the destination of the products: what ratio of the global production will be eaten by people, and what ratio will serve to feed the animals.

## Data

- Food consumption data is based on the Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FBS. The dataset is from 2021 for food consumption per country, and from 2013 for the food or feed ratio.
- Resources and emissions data comes from the following dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/selfvivek/environment-impact-of-food-production.
